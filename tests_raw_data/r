## Training LLM to turn a concrete test case into an AFL-interface template

The idea is to take a program:
```
int
main()
{
	int x;
	
	x = 4;
	return x - 4;
}
```
from a known source, say: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c
and ask the LLM model to do the following. Please create two C files from the file above. The first file, should contain no additional includes, but be documented with two additional comments: time and date, and the source of this file. The second file is similar to the first file but with the following twist. It replaces all constants in the function main, with args assignments and of course, adds any includes needed, and the comments before with date and time and the source of the original file.

ChatGPT gave us for the example above, the following two files:

Program 1 (00003.c):
```
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 17:40:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;

    x = 4;
    return x - 4;
}

```

and Program 2 (00003.c):
```
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 15:30:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s <value>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  int x = atoi(argv[1]);
  return x - 4;
}
```

This will give us two programs to start our work.
