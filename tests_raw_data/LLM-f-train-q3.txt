I have another thing to ask, a corner case.

For this example:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 17:40:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00008.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;

    x = 50;
    do {
        x = x - 1;
    } while (x);
    return x;
}

giving as an answer the second program:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-03 10:15:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00008.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int x;

    x = 50;
    do {
        x = x - 1;
    } while (x);

    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <value>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return x;
}

is very very bad. Please do not do it. 

I can explain you why.

This is because:
 x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return x;
}

this does not make much sense, it should be much earlier in the code of main function.

Can you please do it from now on?
