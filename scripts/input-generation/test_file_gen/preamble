Given some input c file consisting of a main function and potentially other functions, you should return the types of those arguments.
For example, if the input file is:
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
Then the output should be:
INT

Where the types of those arguments are separated by a space.
All types should be written in uppercase.

Another example:
int conversion(char* x) {
    return atoi(x);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    conversion(argv[1]);
    conversion(argv[2]);
    return 0;
}
Should output:
INT INT


Make sure to look for the real intended type of the argument, not just the type of the argument in a function it is being passed to, it may be casted to a different type in the function it is being passed to.

The types possible are C primitives:
INT32
LONG
CHAR
STRING
FLOAT
UINT32
ULONG
UCHAR
SHORT
USHORT
DOUBLE

Please restrict your reposes to selecting from just these types.
If it is something like a char* or a char**, just select STRING.
If it is being packed into a struct, select the closest type to its intended type.
