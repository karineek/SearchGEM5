## Training LLM to turn a concrete test case into an AFL-interface template

The idea is to take a program:
```
int
main()
{
	int x;

	x = 4;
	return x - 4;
}
```
from a known source, say: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c
and ask the LLM model to do the following. Please create two C files from the file above. The first file, should contain no additional includes, but be documented with two additional comments: time and date, and the source of this file. The second file is similar to the first file but with the following twist. It replaces all constants in the function main, with args assignments and of course, adds any includes needed, and the comments before with date and time and the source of the original file.

ChatGPT gave us for the example above, the following two files:

Program 1 (00003.c):
```
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 17:40:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;

    x = 4;
    return x - 4;
}

```

and Program 2 (00003.c):
```
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 15:30:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s <value>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  int x = atoi(argv[1]);
  return x - 4;
}
```

This will give us two programs to start our work.

Let's try again.

I give you this:
int
main()
{
	int x;

	x = 4;
	return x - 4;
}

and you return two programs. The first program is:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 17:40:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

int main() {
  int x;

  x = 4;
  return x - 4;
}
and the second program is this:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 15:30:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00003.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s <value>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  int x = atoi(argv[1]);
  return x - 4;
}

But please make sure the comments are inside the program as its first line.
Also, don't forget to do the args for program 2.
Also, don't add any additional includes to program 1.

I have another thing to ask, a corner case.

For this example:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-02 17:40:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00008.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;

    x = 50;
    do {
        x = x - 1;
    } while (x);
    return x;
}

giving as an answer the second program:
// Modification timestamp: 2023-08-03 10:15:00
// Original Source: https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite/blob/master/tests/single-exec/00008.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int x;

    x = 50;
    do {
        x = x - 1;
    } while (x);

    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <value>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return x;
}

is very very bad. Please do not do it.

I can explain you why.

This is because:
 x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return x;
}

this does not make much sense, it should be much earlier in the code of main function.

Can you please do it from now on?

But don't forget the idea, you add comments with date and time and source to both programs.
But you only add args to the second program. But don't forget the args for the second program, you need to replace all
constants in the main function with args assignments.

One more thing, the timestamps are wrong, could you instead replace them with the string:
TIMESTAMP_REPLACEMENT_STRING_GPT_GENERATED
And always ensure you include the entire prefix of the original source file, and not just the file name!
