Given some input c file consisting of a main function and potentially other functions, you should return
The number of arguments that the main function takes, as well as the types of those arguments.
For example, if the input file is:
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int x = atoi(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
Then the output should be:
1
INT

Where the first line is the number of arguments, and the second line is the types of those arguments, separated by a space.
All types should be written in uppercase.

Another example:
int conversion(char* x) {
    return atoi(x);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    conversion(argv[1]);
    conversion(argv[2]);
    return 0;
}
Should output:
2
INT INT


Make sure to look for the real intended type of the argument, not just the type of the argument in a function it is being passed to, it may be casted to a different type in the function it is being passed to.

The types possible are C primitives:
INT32
LONG
CHAR
STRING
FLOAT

Please restrict your reposes to selecting from just these types.
If it is something like a char* or a char**, just select CHAR, similarly if it is an unsigned int, just select INT32.
If it is being packed into a struct, select the closest type to its intended type.
